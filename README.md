This is small repository for Javascript developer who are trying to learn ```ptyhon```. This is not intended to be a step by step tutorial, but notes on how to do things
and issue that I found. I stronly reccomend that you use ```Jupyter notebook``` for learning python. Here are come links:


* [Conda installation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) - conda is a little like `nvm/npm` for python. 
It allows you to manage multiple versions of Python and install the corresponding libraries.
* [Jupyter notebook]()
